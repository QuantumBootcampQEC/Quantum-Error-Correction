# Quantum-Error-Correction

Quantum error-correction codes address error problem by providing means to identify and correct corresponding errors. 

## INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION

The concept of error correction is a central component of classical information theory, and similarly quantum error correction (QEC).
Quantum states are very delicate and require error correction methods to make quantum computers more reliable.
Classical error correction codes are not applicable to quantum computers as they may effect the quantum state.
Quantum error correction allows us to untilize the great potential of quantum computers.

## QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION CHALLENGES
1- Quantum computers face different types of errors than classical computers.
2- Quantum information is very secure and cannot be duplicated.
3- To reduce the loss of information, we have targeted detecting and correcting errors instead of mitigating possible errors.

## RESULTS
To test the code, have sent the message "0" for 1024 times and compared the results with and without applying the correction code
